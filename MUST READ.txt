REST Based Web Application using Springboot:

GITHUB LINK: https://github.com/Shubham11Jain/XperiSpringbootWebApplication

NOTE: The web application is up and running locally with the server port = 9091

** NOTE : I am still learning the spring framework and springboot, so now i will work
	  on the upgradation part of this REST Based Web Application.
	  I'll try to add more features to this application.

	  The existing features are: 
		1. Form validation and add the employee details.
		2. Reset the details.
		3. Data inserted in oracle database.
		4. Show All Employees Details.

	  The features that I'll add and currently working on are:
		1. Update the details of employee like his/her Name and Job Type
			by giving a button "Update",
		2. Delete the details of a particular employee by giving a button "Delete".


Thank you
